1. First go through Thread Impl and looper and handlers
2. When an app is running it has its main thread which handles light weight operation. Main thread in an application
   is responsible for lightweight operations such as UI interactions, mathematical operations. Heavy operations such
   as network activities, file operations, and database queries are offloaded to background threads to avoid blocking
   the main thread. Too many thread can also crash your aap with out of memory.Because creating threads is very very expensive.
   And if you create more and more threads, then there would be a time when your device will run out of memory.
   And eventually once again your app will shut down.
3. So say hello to coroutines.When you use coroutines then you don't have to create so many threads for each operation.
   Instead You can have just one background thread And on this thread, you can launch coroutines.
   Such as launch a coroutine to perform File UploadLaunch another coroutine on the same background thread
   to perform some network operations. Like threads, coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other to finish,
   and even communicate with each other.But remember coroutines are not threads.

4. Then go to coroutineAmit
