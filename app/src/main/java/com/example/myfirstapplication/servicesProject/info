************SERVICES************
Services in Android are components that perform long-running operations in the background.
Unlike Activities, Services don't provide a user interface. Services can be started from an activity or another component and
continue to run in the background even after the user leaves the application. Uses of services

Playing music in the background
Fetching data from the internet
Handling network transactions
Performing file I/O operations

**Types of Services. There are three primary types of services in Android:
-Started Service: A Started Service is a service that is started when a component (such as an activity) calls startService().
Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.
It needs to stop itself by calling stopSelf() or another component can stop it by calling stopService()

-Bound Service: A service that is bound to one or more components (such as activities) that bind to it using bindService().
It provides a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results,
and do so across processes.

-Foreground Service: A service that is given higher priority and must display a notification to the user.
This type of service is used for tasks that the user is actively aware of, such as music playback or location tracking.
